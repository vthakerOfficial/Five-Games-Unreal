**Each game explained**


**1. Warehouse Wreckege**
About: Set in a warehouse with various objects, this was my first game with Unreal Engine where I learned the basics of blueprint.
Objective: Create chaos as you send objects flying
Gameplay: Aim and launch projectiles that send warehouse objects flying.

**2. Obstacle Assault**
About: Set on floating islands, this game taught me how to make objects move and spin and how to create and apply C++ logic.
Objective: Reach the finish line.
Gameplay: Traverse the tricky landscape by outmaneuvering the moving and spinning objects trying to knock you off the island.

**3. Crypt Raider**
About: Set in a crypt, this game taught me how to create maps for players to traverse, modify lighting, grab objects, and code triggers that can detect objects. I also learned to create puzzles that tested the player's awareness and critical thinking.
Objective: Successfully raid a crypt of its treasure.
Gameplay: Navigate an eerie crypt and complete puzzles that require critical thinking.

**4. Toon Tanks**
About: This game taught me how to utilize Unreal Engine functionality to make turrets that constantly shoot the player, create camera lag, and detect if the player is within range.
Objective: Kill all enemy tanks.
Gameplay: As a tank, you must eliminate all enemy tanks before they eliminate you.

**5. Simple Shooter**
About: By far the most complicated, this game taught me how to create bullets, enemy AI robot shooters that navigate the terrain and shoot at the player, sound effects, music, and animations.
Objective: Eliminate all enemy robots.
Gameplay: Traverse the futuristic building, eliminating any robot shooters you see. If they take sight of you, they will pursue you until they lose line of sight of you. After a delay, the robot will return to their original position. Some robots even patrol an area.
