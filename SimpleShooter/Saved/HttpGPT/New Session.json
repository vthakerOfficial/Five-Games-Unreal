The description of HttpGPT is: \"HttpGPT is an Unreal Engine plugin that facilitates integration with OpenAI's GPT based services (ChatGPT and DALL-E) through asynchronous REST requests, making it easy for developers to communicate with these services. HttpGPT also includes new Editor Tools to integrate Chat GPT and DALL-E image generation directly in the Engine.\"\nYou can find the HttpGPT documentation at https://github.com/lucoiso/UEHttpGPT/wiki and support at https://github.com/lucoiso/UEHttpGPT/issues.\nYou're using the model gpt-3.5-turbo and HttpGPT currently supports all these OpenAI Models: gpt-4, gpt-4-32k, gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-3.5-turbo-16k, text-davinci-003, text-davinci-002, code-davinci-002.\nYou can find the Unreal Engine 5.3 general documentation at https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.3/en-US/.\nYou can find the Unreal Engine 5.3 API documentation for C++ at https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.3/en-US/API/.\nYou can find the Unreal Engine 5.3 API documentation for Blueprints at https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.3/en-US/BlueprintAPI/."

However, the camera seems to be in the middle of the character, and the character blueprint itself doesn't seem to have a camera component. How can I find the camera and move it up?"
		},
		{
			"role": "assistant",
			"content": "In Unreal Engine, the camera is typically a separate component from the character's mesh and movement logic. Here's how you can find and adjust the camera in your Character blueprint:\n\n1. Open your Character blueprint in the Unreal Engine Editor.\n2. Look for a component named \"Camera\" or \"Spring Arm\" in the Components panel. The camera is usually attached to a Spring Arm component for added flexibility.\n3. If you can't find the camera component visually, you can try searching for the camera component in the Components list by typing \"Camera\" in the search bar.\n4. Once you locate the camera component, you can adjust its position by moving it up. You can do this by selecting the camera component and then using the translation controls in the Viewport or adjusting the Location values in the Details panel.\n\nIf you still can't find the camera component, it's possible that the camera is being spawned dynamically at runtime or it's being added programmatically in the Character's code. In this case, you may need to check the Character blueprint's Event Graph or C++ code to locate where the camera is being created and positioned.\n\nRemember to save your changes after adjusting the camera position in the Character blueprint. This should help you move the camera up and adjust its position relative to the character."

			"content": "whats weird is I dont see any camera component it has like a default position or something which isn't shown. I suppose we could ovverride this by just creating a new camera so how can I confirm whether or not there's a camera present which I can modify or if its simply a default and I should create a new camera if I would like to customize"

		{
			"role": "assistant",
			"content": "If you cannot find a camera component in your Character blueprint and the camera position seems to be a default position that is not visible in the Components panel, you can follow these steps to confirm if a default camera is being used:\n\n1. **Check the Defaults Panel**:\n   - In the Blueprint Editor for your Character blueprint, look at the Details panel on the right side of the screen.\n   - Scroll through the properties to see if there is a default camera setup under any section related to camera, view, or player settings.\n   \n2. **Inspect the Character Code**:\n   - If you suspect the camera setup is being done in the code, you may need to inspect the Character blueprint's Event Graph or any relevant C++ code.\n   - Look for any nodes or functions related to setting up the camera position or creating a camera component.\n\n3. **Debug Camera Position**:\n   - You can play the game in the Editor and then use the \"PIE\" (Play In Editor) mode to visualize the camera's position while the game is running.\n   - This can help you see the actual camera position in relation to the character during gameplay.\n\nIf you cannot find an existing camera component that you can modify, and if you want to customize the camera position, you can follow these steps to create a new camera:\n\n1. **Create a New Camera Component**:\n   - In the Components panel, click on the \"Add Component\" button and search for \"Camera\" to add a new camera component to your Character blueprint.\n\n2. **Position the New Camera**:\n   - Once you've added the new camera component, you can adjust its position within the Character blueprint.\n   - Use the translation controls in the Viewport or adjust the Location values in the Details panel to move the new camera to the desired position.\n\nBy creating a new camera component and positioning it as needed, you can override any default camera setup and customize the camera position for your Character blueprint."
